The SGate payment system is used to complete the merchant's collection. The main docking process is for the merchant to create a payment order through the interface and guide the payer (buyer) to the SGate payment page. After completing the payment, SGate will guide the payer's browser to redirect to the merchant page. Merchants will also be notified through the server.
