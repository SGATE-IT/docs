# Sensitive Information Processing

In order to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information fields (such as bank card numbers, phone numbers, etc.) during the communication process, merchants are required to encrypt the <b>submitted</b> sensitive information fields using the system [public key](/en/payoutApi/apiRule/certificateKey#system-public-key). Correspondingly, the system will encrypt the sensitive information fields <b>below</b> using the merchant's [public key](/en/payoutApi/apiRule/certificateKey#merchant-public-private-key), and the merchant needs to decrypt them using the merchant's [private key](/en/payoutApi/apiRule/certificateKey#merchant-public-private-key) to obtain the original information.
